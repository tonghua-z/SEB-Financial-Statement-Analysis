       "'Good start to the year but Q2 and Q3 the key for 2010 performance. The Q1 2010 revenues grew by 7.3% year-on-year and were in line with our estimate. The Q1 2010 EBIT of EUR 7.5m also showed growth, matching our EUR 7.6m forecast, with in line margins (consensus: EUR 4.6m). Tikkurila said that despite the good start to the year, the market remains challenging and visibility is not high at this time of the year. As Q1 2010 is a small quarter in terms of revenues and EBIT (Q2 and Q3 the key for the full year), the guidance for flat revenues and EBIT (ex. currency changes) was maintained despite the growth in Q1 2010. Estimates intact; we have 12.2% net sales and EUR 7m EBIT growth for 2010. SBU East already saw some volume growth in Q1 2010 and pre-order sales in Finland have started well, according to Tikkurila. Much of the full year performance is dependent on the exterior painting season but we believe our 2.8% volume growth estimate for 2010 is on the safe side. If the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble and the Polish zloty remain at current levels throughout 2010, we forecast currencies will boost the top line by 6.7% in 2010 versus 2009. Finally, as cost savings seem to be on track, we see no reason to change our EUR 7m EBIT improvement for 2010 (over 2009). We forecast 12.2% revenue growth for 2010. Attractive growth case, cash-flow to be strong. Tikkurila looks attractive due to its strong Russian market share (18%) and growth potential, which is the basis for our 2010-12 growth forecasts. Also, investors should not underestimate the impact of the Sochi Olympic games on the area’s paint consumption by 2014. Capex guidance is about EUR 20m for 2010-12; as there is no need for capacity expansion, we estimate strong cash flow for 2010-12. '"
